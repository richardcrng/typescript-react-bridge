# TypeScript Bridge

The objective of this course is to support you in learning _just enough TypeScript_ as you will need for basic React.

At the moment, this course does not cover:

- basic JavaScript (on the roadmap)
- basic React (on the roadmap)

The priority is on supplementing existing JS and React resources (of which there are many!) to support the novice developer who wants to use React with TypeScript.

## How this is structured

1. Introduction - this covers the TypeScript Playground, which we suggest as a learning environment
2. Benefits of TypeScript - this shows how TypeScript adds some extra sensible benefits on top of JavaScript
3. Typing Variables - this introduces some first bits of TypeScript-specific syntax

## How to use

We recommend pasting every exercise into the [TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play) and exploring the code that way.

Once you've done that, pretty much every exercise should be approached in the same way:

1. 👁️ Read the code
2. 🤔 Predict what will happen when you run the code
3. 👟 Run the code and compare your prediction
4. 👩🏽‍🔬 Experiment with changes (change -> predict -> run)
5. 🧠 Try to complete the challenge(s)

### Removing the final line for the Playground

Every exercise ends with the below snippet:

```ts
export {};
```

**Don't paste this final line into the Playground** (or, alternatively, delete it after you've pasted it in).
