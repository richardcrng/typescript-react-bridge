# TypeScript Bridge

The objective of this course is to support you in learning _just enough TypeScript_ as you will need for basic React.

At the moment, this course does not cover:

- basic JavaScript (on the roadmap)
- basic React (on the roadmap)

The priority is on supplementing existing JS and React resources (of which there are many!) to support the novice developer who wants to use React with TypeScript.
