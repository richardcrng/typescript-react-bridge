/* Lesson: How TypeScript helps us to avoid silly typos (1/1)
 *
 * Learning outcomes:
 *  - Explain how TypeScript can help us to spot silly typos
 *      before they happen
 *
 * Instructions:
 *  1. 👁️ Read the code
 *  2. 🤔 Predict what will happen when you run the code
 *  3. 👟 Run the code and compare your prediction
 *  4. 👩🏽‍🔬 Experiment with changes (change -> predict -> run)
 *  5. 🧠 Try to complete the challenge(s)
 *
 * Study questions:
 *  1. How do the TypeScript compilation errors help us find the
 *      JavaScript runtime errors and unexpected behaviour?
